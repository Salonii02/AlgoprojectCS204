Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon(Bollywood Version)
Six Degrees of Seperation Concept-It is a theory that anyone on the earth can be connected to any other person on the planet through a chain of acquaintances that has no more than five intermediaries.
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon is a parlor game based on the "six degrees of separation" concept, which posits that any two people on earth are six or fewer acquaintance links apart. The Bacon Number is defined as follows: Kevin Bacon has a Bacon Number of 0,people who co-starred in a movie with Kevin Bacon have a Bacon Number of 1, people who co-starred in a movie with someone who has a Bacon Number of 1 in turn have a Bacon Number of 2 and so on.Given any actor/actress, the goal of the game is to establish their Bacon Number by a sequence of movies and co-stars.
Similar to this idea we are trying to make a game of Bollywood Movies and prolific Character actors such as Amir Khan. In this game movie buffs challenge each other to find the shortest distance between an arbitrary actor and prolific character actor “Amir Khan”.Choice of Amir khan is arbitrary; we can connect any other actor to the corresponding actor.
